## Description

Parses a 'Requires Plugins' header and adds a Dependencies tab in the plugin install page. If a requiring plugin does not have all its dependencies installed and active, it will not activate.

[Make post for Plugin Dependencies Feature Project](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/02/24/feature-project-plugin-dependencies/)

My solution to [#22316](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22316). Feature plugin version of [PR #3032](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/3032)

* Parses the **Requires Plugins** header that defines plugin dependencies using a comma separated list of wp.org slugs.
* This view also lists which plugins require which plugin dependencies in the plugin card.
* In the plugins page, a dependent plugin is unable to be deleted or deactivated if the requiring plugin is active.
* Plugin dependencies can be deactivated or deleted if the requiring plugin is not active.
* Messaging in the plugin row description is inserted; as is data noting which plugins require the dependency.
* Circular dependencies cannot be activated and an admin notice noting the circular dependencies is displayed.
* Ensures that plugins with unmet dependencies cannot be activated.

There are several single file plugins that may be used for testing in `test-plugins/`.
